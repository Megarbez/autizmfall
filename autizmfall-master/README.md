# Meteor Spyfall

Spyfall on your mobile device!

This is the code that currently runs [http://spyfall.crabhat.com](http://spyfall.crabhat.com). It's a simple site I've built as a learning project, so definitely don't use it as an example of Meteor best practices. Pull requests welcome!

## Disclaimer

[Spyfall](http://international.hobbyworld.ru/spyfall) is a party game designed by Alexandr Ushan and published by [Hobby World](http://international.hobbyworld.ru/). This is an unofficial fan project designed to complement the physical game, and is not endorsed in any way by the designer or publisher.

## Translations

If you'd like to see the site in your own language, there are two ways to contribute a translation - Transifex or pull request.

### Transifex

Transifex is an easy to use translation service. It has a nice interface and is great for non-programmers. Simply go to the following link:

[https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/spyfall/](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/spyfall/)

Then click the big "Help Translate Spyfall" button. After creating a user account you should be able to start working on a translation right away. Once you're done, I'll be sent an email and will add your translation to the live site as soon as possible.

### Pull request

If you're comfortable with Github and JSON files, feel free to simply create a new file in the `spyfall/i18n` directory, using `en.i18n.json` as a base.

### Notes for translators

Please make sure that the translations you provide are as close as possible to the original meaning - try not to alter roles or locations, as I'd like the game to still be playable when different players in the same game are using different languages.

## Running your own instance with custom locations

[Install meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)

Clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/evanbrumley/spyfall.git ./spyfall

Enter the spyfall directory:

	cd spyfall/spyfall

Edit the locations file as required:

	nano lib/locations.js

Run the meteor server to test locally:

	meteor --settings settings/example.json

Sadly, production deployment has gotten a little trickier since meteor.com stopped providing easy free hosting. I recommend a combination of digitalocean.com and mupx for a relatively easy and robust solution.

## Docker

To run this instance in a docker container, check out [noamokman/docker-spyfall](https://github.com/noamokman/docker-spyfall)
